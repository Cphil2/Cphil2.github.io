        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Formed in Pittsburg between 1988 and 1992, Anti-Flag is known for its unapologetic political views that often revolve around criticism of the United State, war protest, and anti-capitalism.  The bands name is a take on the founding bassist - Andy Flag, who was only a member of the band until 1996.  Since 1999 the band has consisted of stoic Pat Thetic on drums, soft spoken Chris #2 on backup guitar, the rugged and angry Chris Head on bass, and Justin Sane as the energetic political spear on lead guitar and vocals.  Chris Head and Justin split vocal time quite often.</p>
        <p>I started listening to Anti-Flag when I was 13/14 and they had a large impact on how I think critically about the world, and how I shouldnâ€™t trust one voice, eventually questioning theirs as well.  Some would call them punk sell outs, to me, they just evolve.  They have more energy than most bands I can think of, and they always passionate a great show.</p>
